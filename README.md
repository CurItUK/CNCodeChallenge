# CNCodeChallenge
 
A sample app developed using loosely coupled tested MVVM TDD.

In this small app I used MVVM architecture protocol oriented programming with protocol inheritence. Loose coupling is provided using protocol oriented mocks inside tests. Mocks Stubs and fakes used throughout the code. Aysncronous server calls and lazy vars used to keep the app smooth and working. UI is very basic as the main reason is to show the architecting. Autolayouts and constraints used throughout the UI.
